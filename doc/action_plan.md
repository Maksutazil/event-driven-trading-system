# Event-Driven Trading System - Action Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the strategic improvement plan for our event-driven trading system based on the recent comprehensive system review.

### Implementation Details

#### Integration Test Framework
We've created a comprehensive integration test framework located in the `tests/integration` directory. The framework includes:

- `BaseIntegrationTest`: Base class that provides common setup and utility methods for all integration tests
- Mock implementations for event bus, feature providers, and model manager
- Test data generation utilities for creating consistent test data

#### Implemented Integration Tests

1. **Model Prediction Flow Test** (`test_model_prediction_flow.py`):
   - Validates that MODEL_PREDICTION events are properly processed
   - Verifies that model predictions influence trading signal generation
   - Tests the complete flow from model prediction to trading decision

2. **Cross-Component Error Handling Test** (`test_error_handling.py`):
   - Tests that errors in ML components are properly handled by trading components
   - Validates error recovery mechanisms and system resilience
   - Ensures error events are properly published and handled
   - Tests the retry mechanism for transient errors

3. **Feature Naming Standardization Test** (`test_feature_naming.py`):
   - Verifies feature names follow the standardized convention (category.provider.name)
   - Tests feature consistency across ML and Trading components
   - Validates feature transformation maintains naming standards
   - Ensures feature access methods are consistent across components

4. **Model Training Workflow Test** (`test_model_training_workflow.py`):
   - Tests the complete model training job lifecycle
   - Validates data collection, model training, and evaluation
   - Verifies proper model artifact management and event publishing
   - Tests error handling for insufficient data scenarios

5. **Configuration Consistency Test** (`test_configuration_consistency.py`):
   - Verifies configuration parameters are properly propagated across components
   - Tests consistency of shared parameters (e.g., model_prediction_weight)
   - Validates configuration merging in the TradingSystemFactory
   - Tests configuration update propagation via events

## Conclusion

This action plan provides a structured approach to enhancing our event-driven trading system, building on the strong foundation already in place. By completing these phases, we will have a production-ready system with comprehensive testing, optimized performance, and robust monitoring capabilities.

Significant progress has been made with the completion of the integration testing phase, with all five key integration tests now implemented and a CI pipeline configured:
- Model prediction flow test
- Cross-component error handling test
- Feature naming standardization test
- Model training workflow test
- Configuration consistency test
- GitHub Actions CI pipeline for automated testing

These tests validate critical integration points between ML and Trading components, ensuring robust and reliable system behavior.

The next immediate priorities are:
1. Begin performance profiling to identify optimization opportunities
2. Start implementing performance metrics collection
3. Execute the integration tests through the CI pipeline

Progress will be tracked weekly, with adjustments made to the plan as needed based on findings and changing priorities.
