# Event-Driven Trading System Improvements Plan

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the comprehensive improvement plan for our event-driven trading system. The system consists of four main modules:

1. Events Module - Core event bus and event processing infrastructure
2. Features Module - Feature calculation, caching, and management
3. Trading Module - Trading strategies, signal generation, and order management
4. Machine Learning Module - Model training, prediction, and integration with trading decisions

The plan addresses integration issues between these modules and establishes code quality requirements for the entire system.

## 3. Code Quality Requirements

### 3.1 Clean Code Principles

1. Use consistent naming conventions across all modules
2. Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
3. Limit function parameters to maintain readability
4. Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code
5. Use meaningful comments to explain "why" not "what"

### 3.2 Documentation Requirements

1. All public classes and functions must have docstrings
2. Include examples in docstrings for complex functionality
3. Maintain high-level architecture documentation
4. Document event types and their payloads
5. Keep inline comments up to date with code changes

### 3.3 Testing Requirements

1. Maintain minimum 80% code coverage for core modules
2. Write unit tests for each new feature or bug fix
3. Include integration tests for component interactions
4. Use mocks for external dependencies
5. Test error handling and edge cases

### 3.4 Error Handling

1. Use custom exception types for different error categories
2. Log all exceptions with appropriate context
3. Implement graceful degradation for non-critical failures
4. Apply consistent error recovery strategies
5. Include error reporting to centralized logging system

### 3.5 Performance Considerations

1. Optimize critical paths with profiling before and after changes
2. Implement appropriate caching strategies
3. Use asynchronous processing for non-blocking operations
4. Monitor and log performance metrics
5. Document resource requirements and scaling limitations
